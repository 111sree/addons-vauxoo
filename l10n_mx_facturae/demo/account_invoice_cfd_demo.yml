  To test the Mexican Electronic Invoice CFD
-
  I create a cfd customer invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_cfd0, view: account.invoice_form}:
    payment_term: account.account_payment_term_advance
    journal_id: l10n_mx_cfd_journal_0
    partner_id: l10n_mx_partner_address.res_partner_address_vauxoo_1
    reference_type: none
    name: 'Test cfd Customer Invoice'
    invoice_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_5
        quantity: 22.0
-
  I rewrite the journal field (BUG I need overwrite two times this field for done! only in test yaml)
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_cfd0, view: account.invoice_form}:
    journal_id: l10n_mx_cfd_journal_0
