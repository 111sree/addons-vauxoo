  Test for check a invoice broker
-
  I set the context as would do the action in supplier invoice menuitem
-
  !context
    'default_type': 'in_invoice'
-
  I create a supplier invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_broker, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}:
    account_id: account.a_pay
    check_total: 160.0
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_expense
        name: '[Importation]Product for importation'
        price_unit: 1000.0
        product_id: account_broker.product_product_broker_payment
        quantity: 0.0
        invoice_line_tax_id:
            - account_tax_purchase_iva16_broker
        invoice_broker_id: account.demo_invoice_0
    journal_id: account.expenses_journal
    partner_id: res_partner_supplier_broker
    reference_type: none
-
  I update quantity = 0 in line to invoice created
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    invoice_br = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('account_invoice_supplier_broker'))
    for line in invoice_br.invoice_line:
        line.write({'quantity': 0.0})
-
  I change the state of invoice to open by clicking Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_supplier_broker}
-
  I check that the invoice state is now "Open"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_broker}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I set the context that will be used for the encoding of all the vouchers of this file
-
  !context
    'type': 'payment'
-
  I create the voucher of payment with values 160.0
-
  !record {model: account.voucher, id: account_voucher_invoice_broker, view: account_voucher.view_vendor_payment_form}:
    account_id: account.cash
    company_id: base.main_company
    amount: 160.80
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    name: 'Payment invoice broker'
    partner_id: res_partner_supplier_broker
    date: !eval time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    type: 'payment'
-
  I click to validate button on voucher
-
  !workflow {model: account.voucher, action: proforma_voucher, ref: account_voucher_invoice_broker}
-
  I check that the voucher state is now "Posted"
-
  !assert {model: account.voucher, id: account_voucher_tax1}:
    - state == 'posted'
-
  I check that the invoice state is now "Paid"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_tax0}:
    - state == 'paid'
# -
#   I check that the Journal Items is generated with tax section from voucher
# -
